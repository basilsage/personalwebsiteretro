<hr>

I still remember the first time I heard the term "data business." That day fundamentally altered the course of my one life on this planet (no offense @ buddhists).

At the time, I was working as a product manager at <a href="https://pitchbook.com" target="_blank">PitchBook</a> — which today I consider to be a quintessential (and world-class) "data business." But back then, I didn't have this concept in my vocabulary. All I knew was that I found PitchBook fascinating as a business. I was obsessed with how the company operated thousands of web scrapers that crawled the internet every second of every day. I was fascinated by the vast engine of automations, internal tooling, AI, and human operations it required to transform messy, unstructured content into clean, queryable datasets that VC firms paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to access.

One day, my teammate (shoutout Claire Bowman — let's catch up sometime) dropped a link in the Slack channel for our PM team: <a href="https://pivotal.substack.com/p/economics-of-data-biz" target="_blank">The Economics of Data Businesses</a> by Abraham Thomas. For a young me, this might as well have been Moses descending the hill with holy tablets. The essay introduced the concept of data businesses, analyzed how businesses like PitchBook operated, and explained why they worked so well.

I must have read it 5+ times that first week. I remember driving home thinking about data businesses. I kept thinking about them in the shower. For the first time, I had the vocabulary to articulate why I loved PitchBook—not just as a product, but as a business.

Since then:
- I've probably re-read that essay a couple dozen more times
- I've pestered dozens of my friends to read it
- I've hacked together multiple data business side projects
- I bought <a href="https://www.bloombergbybloomberg.com/" target="_blank">Michael Bloomberg's autobiography</a>, and even read it in public (to my wife's embarrassment)
- I've devoured every piece of writing I can find about data businesses
- I've spent countless hours brainstorming (daydreaming?) startup ideas for data businesses

To put it lightly: I'm obsessed.

<h3>So... what is a data business?</h3>
Whenever I start <s>yapping</s> talking about "data businesses" at a dinner party or happy hour, most people interpret the term in one of two ways:

- A company that uses data in its operations (e.g. Palantir or Netflix)
- A company that sells database technology (e.g. Snowflake, Fivetran)

But I wouldn't define either as data businesses.

The best definition I've come across comes from that original <a href="https://pivotal.substack.com/p/economics-of-data-biz" target="_blank">Abraham Thomas piece</a>:

<blockquote><i>Every company uses data, but not every company is a data business. A company is a data business if, and only if, data is its core product. Data is central to the activity of the company; without the data, there is no company.</i></blockquote>
<h3>Why am I obsessed with data businesses?</h3>
I've spent a lot of time thinking about this. I think it's that, as a Biz Boy™️ who geeks on studying business models and strategy frameworks, data businesses are nearly perfect businesses. They hit all the dopamine receptors:
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 2rem;">
<li><strong>They scale beautifully</strong>. Once you've built a data asset, the marginal cost of providing incremental licenses to access that data is virtually zero.</li>
<li><strong>They have defensible moats</strong> (see: Bloomberg). There are massive starting costs to standing up an initial data corpus with sufficient critical mass to be valuable: developing scrapers, hiring humans-in-the-loop, building QA mechanisms. Further, any new market entrants with a "unique angle" can quickly have that angle copied by incumbents, who already have all the aforementioned infrastructure in place. All they need to do is tweak their scrapers slightly, and your unique angle is no longer unique.</li>
<li><strong>They can become an "industry standard"</strong> (again, see: Bloomberg). Once your data becomes an industry standard, everyone in that industry must purchase your data, else they risk looking foolish. Consider a hedge fund that doesn't use Bloomberg.</li>
<li><strong>They naturally lend themselves to compelling content marketing</strong>. Unique datasets, once assembled, are a goldmine for content. Top ten lists? Sure. Deep dives into the data? Absolutely. Data visualizations? You betcha!</li>
</ul>
Plus... philosophically... they're kind of romantic? They take the infinite chaos of the internet and organize it into something legible, clean, and useful. It tickles my brain in the same way as Laplace's demon:

<blockquote><i>In 1814, Laplace described an entity that would be able to calculate any future event if it knew the precise location and speed of every atom in the Universe, based on the principle of cause and effect. This will be known as Laplace's Demon. At that time, scientists believed that they could solve all the mysteries of the Universe (source: <a href="https://miguelgfierro.com/blog/2017/laplaces-demon-and-the-scientific-method/" target="_blank">Miguel González-Fierro</a>)</i></blockquote>

<h3>So why write about this?</h3>
Because I'm still obsessed. I still read that Abraham Thomas essay every other month. I still think about data businesses in the shower. And I would love to connect with any other nerds out there <s>who are also sick in the head like me</s>. My hope is if you're still reading this far, you might be one of them.
