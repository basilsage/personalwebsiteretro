ROUGH DRAFT ; CLEAN UP LATER

I still remember the first time I heard the term “data business.” That day genuinely changed the course of my one life (no offense, Buddhists) on this planet.

At the time, I was working as a product manager at PitchBook—what I now consider to be a world-class, quintessential data business. But back then, I didn’t have the language for it. All I knew was that I found PitchBook endlessly fascinating. I was obsessed with how the company ran millions of web scrapers, 24/7. I geeked out over how it transformed messy, unstructured content into clean, queryable datasets that VC firms paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to access.

One day, my teammate (shoutout Claire Bowman—let’s catch up sometime) dropped a link in our PM team Slack: The Economics of Data Businesses by Abraham Thomas. It was a bullseye. The piece broke down exactly how PitchBook worked, and more importantly, why it worked so well.

I must have read it a dozen times that first week. I remember driving home thinking about data businesses. I kept thinking about them in the shower. For the first time, I had the vocabulary to articulate why I loved PitchBook—not just as a product, but as a business.

Since then:

I’ve re-read that essay over 100 times.

I’ve shared it with dozens of friends, usually begging them to read it.

I’ve built multiple data business side projects:

Frequency — a queryable database of podcast transcripts for brand and marketing teams

Shipped.fyi — a queryable database of product release notes

GrantMagic — a database of grant opportunities for nonprofits

Blackbird — a queryable database of web3 wallets

I bought Michael Bloomberg’s autobiography and read it in public, to my wife’s embarrassment.

I’ve devoured every piece of writing I can find about data businesses.

I’ve spent countless hours brainstorming (daydreaming?) data startup ideas.

To put it lightly: I’m obsessed.

So... what is a data business?
Whenever I start going off about data businesses at a dinner party or happy hour, most people interpret the term in one of two ways:

A company that uses data in its operations (e.g. Palantir or Netflix)

A company that sells database technology (e.g. Snowflake, Fivetran)

But I wouldn’t call either of those a data business.

The best definition I’ve come across comes from Abraham Thomas:

Every company uses data, but not every company is a data business. A company is a data business if, and only if, data is its core product. Data is central to the activity of the company; without the data, there is no company. source

So when I say “data business,” here’s what I mean:

The company’s data is the product.

The company’s primary revenue comes from selling access to that data.

To a customer, it might just look like a vendor selling third-party data—but under the hood, it’s something more specialized and elegant.

Why am I obsessed with data businesses?
I’ve spent an embarrassing amount of time thinking about this.

Part of it is that, as a biz boy™️ who loves studying business models and strategy frameworks, data businesses are simply perfect businesses. They hit all the dopamine receptors:

They scale beautifully. The marginal cost of delivering data is often near-zero.

They have defensible moats. Clean, proprietary, or hard-to-collect data is hard to compete with.

They often become industry standards. Once customers rely on a data source, switching is painful.

They thrive on content marketing. Publishing data insights becomes a flywheel for growth.

And philosophically, they’re kind of romantic? They take the infinite chaos of the internet and organize it into something legible, clean, and useful.

It’s hard to describe, but there's something deeply satisfying—and maybe even optimistic—about turning noise into signal. It scratches the same itch as Laplace’s demon or Westworld-level worldbuilding: a belief that with enough structure, any system can be understood.

It’s also why I find Naval’s whole “diver vs. surfer” analogy so compelling. Data businesses are for divers. You go deep. You mine. You organize the chaos. And what you pull out can be breathtakingly valuable.

So why write about this?
Because I’m still obsessed. Because I read that Abraham Thomas essay monthly. Because I keep chasing that same high from my first week at PitchBook. Because I want to build (and help others build) more of these beautiful, nerdy, efficient businesses.

And maybe, just maybe, because I want to find my fellow data freaks out there.

Let’s talk soon.
