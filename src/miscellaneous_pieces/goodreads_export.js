<h3>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ all time faves</h3>
<li>The Plague - Albert Camus (‚Well, personally, I've seen enough of people who die for an idea. I don't believe in heroism; I know it's easy and I've learned that it can be murderous. What interests me is living and dying for what one loves.‚A relevant and insightful novel in an increasingly hypochondriacal world)</li>
<li>The End of Everything (Astrophysically Speaking) - Katie  Mack (Most people have spent time coming to peace with their own mortality. However, I think very few people have spent time thinking about the end of the universe itself. Unlike our own deaths, where we can leave behind a legacy / family / etc., the death of the universe is absolute -- a complete end to all matter and possibility of life forever. I always love learning anything I can about astrophysics, but this book was truly above and beyond. Katie Mack does a great job explaining incredibly difficult concepts to the average person. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to everyone, to expand their thinking (literally to the edges of the universe) and gain greater appreciation for the machinations of the space that surrounds us.)</li>
<li>The Design of Everyday Things - Donald A. Norman (A life changing book for me, fundamentally changed how I saw the world around me)</li>
<li>Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less - Greg McKeown (A fantastic read, one of the best business / life books I've read, right below Principles. )</li>
<li>The Dharma Bums - Jack Kerouac (Perhaps the most influential book I read in college? :) an all time favorite. )</li>
<li>The Memory Police - Yoko Ogawa (An incredible piece of art; consummate Japanese postmodern literature. Ogawa plucks at your heart strings elegantly and gently, never heavy-handed. I can't wait to read this book again and again.Note: this is relatively subtle literature, not a thriller or romance novel.  Negative goodreads reviews seem to miss this point. It's like giving a Monet a 2 star because it's just a pond )</li>
<li>Super Sad True Love Story - Gary Shteyngart (Permanently changed how I see the world, and incredibly prescient of our trajectory as a society. Predicted twitch )</li>
<li>Breakfast of Champions - Kurt Vonnegut Jr. (Incredible, one of my favorite reads in the past several years. Genius)</li>
<li>Animal Person - Alexander MacLeod (Incredible, this one floored me. Sat on my couch sitting for 10 minutes after holding back tears)</li>
<li>A Gentleman in Moscow - Amor Towles (A delightful novel :) if you find yourself saying ‚I don't get that movie, nothing really happened‚ you may not like this book. Towles shines brightest as he deconstructs the milliseconds of social interactions we take for granted. I loved and highly recommend to all! Especially during COVID (the protagonist is trapped on house arrest...))</li>
<li>Hear the Wind Sing (The Rat, #1) - Haruki Murakami (Murakami's first novel. The novel(la) itself is fantastic for someone with no writing background. But what makes this a true five-star review for me is the foreword ‚ÄòThe Birth of My Kitchen-Table Fiction' in the Vintage International edition of this book. It's an absolute must-read for any Murakami fan, illuminating and awe-inspiring on so many levels. )</li>
<li>A Wild Sheep Chase (The Rat, #3) - Haruki Murakami (Probably my favorite Murakami work and one of the best contemporary novels I've ever read. Murakami is an incredible artist... a conductor of a symphony that's simultaneously magical, haunting, and delightful all at once... in perfect harmony. I can't wait to read this one again. )</li>
<li>Blossoms in the Desert: Topaz High School Class of 1945 - Darrell Y. Hamamoto (A beautiful and poignant glimpse into Topaz, straight from the memories of its residents. Proud that my grandma contributed to its creation :))</li>
<li>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind - Yuval Noah Harari (A must read for everyone. Even if you are familiar with some major themes (eg social construction), I can't imagine anyone who won't find at least some new interesting ideas from this book. Truly a masterful history of mankind. )</li>
<li>When Breath Becomes Air - Paul Kalanithi (Beautiful, incredible prose. A must read for everyone.)</li>
<li>Steve Jobs - Walter Isaacson (An incredibly-written biography about one of the most interesting and influential leaders of all time. Nothing else really needs to be said; it's a must-read for everyone. )</li>
<li>Despair - Vladimir Nabokov (One of my professors in college loved Vladimir Nabokov's quote: "In reading, one should notice and fondle details." Accordingly, whenever reading Nabokov, I always try to devote more time and mindfulness to deeply engaging with his prose. Despair returns dividends on every extra second invested by readers. Per usual, Nabokov authors  scenes that poignantly reflect elements of the human condition in incredibly subtle ways (relative to the heavy-handed approaches of lesser authors). However, the most compelling part of Despair is its keen self-awareness of the novel form. Despair is a frame narrative with a narrator that is vocally self-conscious about his writing. He is aware of his literary peers (Dostoevsky, Pushkin) and frequently interrupts the story to call attention to the contrived nature of the novel form. Despair epitomizes the masterful self-awareness of modernist literature, in which form truly steals the spotlight from plot. I loved Despair and look forward to revisiting it again later in life... a masterpiece!)</li>
<li>Atlas Shrugged - Ayn Rand (A monumental literary work, formidable in ideology and sheer size. While I certainly disagree with many of Ayn Rand's ideas (which she belabors quite heavy-handedly in this novel), I appreciate the thoughtful conviction with which she presents her beliefs and challenges my own. I am leaving this book with a deep sense of accomplishment and a hunger to build great things with my life.)</li>
<li>Principles: Life and Work - Ray Dalio (Incredible thoughts and frameworks from one of the most successful investors of all time. A must-read for anyone, regardless of your profession.)</li>
<li>Sputnik Sweetheart - Haruki Murakami</li>
<li>The Great Gatsby - F. Scott Fitzgerald (My favorite book in HS)</li>

<h3>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ solid, recommend</h3>
<li>The Way of Kings (The Stormlight Archive, #1) - Brandon Sanderson (An epic fantasy novel, 1250 pages of sprawling and immersive world building. It is a long journey, but certainly rewarding. It't about the path! )</li>
<li>1Q84 (1Q84, #1-3) - Haruki Murakami (Started strong, lost some steam)</li>
<li>Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion - Robert B. Cialdini (Pretty cringe branding / book to carry around, but it really is a fascinating pop psych / sociology book. Author is a social psych researcher, embedded himself among ‚compliance professionals‚ (salesmen, preachers, advertisers) to identify their tricks of the trade. A lot of lightbulb moments recognizing why as humans we do the things we do (music in church, hazing in frats, free samples in grocery stores).)</li>
<li>Sea of Tranquility - Emily St. John Mandel (Loved this novel. Especially loved the postmodern motifs of instability of time / identity. This novel is great for any occasion (easy reader, slow literature). I'm excited to read more Emily St. John Mandel)</li>
<li>The Picture of Dorian Gray - Oscar Wilde (Overly dramatic dialogue and indulgent prose, but nonetheless a beautiful and stirring novel. A great read)</li>
<li>Create Dangerously: The Power and Responsibility of the Artist - Albert Camus (A beautiful speech, on the role and responsibility of art.)</li>
<li>A Confederacy of Dunces - John Kennedy Toole (This novel aged horribly with regards to political incorrectness, but it's an incredibly entertaining novel with a bright burning cast of characters. A nice comedic novel and easy reader.)</li>
<li>Bleeding Edge - Thomas Pynchon (A compelling piece of contemporary literature. Not the easiest read. Excited to read again, definitely needs a second read to appreciate.)</li>
<li>Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams - Philip K. Dick (Great sci fi, in short story medium is really nice too, as sci fi world-building can often be incredibly extensive. PKD does great job of world-building succinctly in these short stories)</li>
<li>There There - Tommy Orange (I really enjoyed and appreciated reading this novel about Native Americans in the Bay Area. A perspective that is underrepresented in literature. Would recommend!)</li>
<li>After the Quake - Haruki Murakami (Another beautiful collection of short stories by Murakami. These ones fall a little flatter than his others - less haunting, less magical, less dreamy. But Murakami is still Murakami, and After the Quake is still a delight for a Murakami fan, if not a recommended starting point for a new Murakami reader :))</li>
<li>The Mom Test - Rob Fitzpatrick (Good book! Lots of value density in this short book, great ideas on how to conduct more effective user interviews that will stick with me for the rest of my career.)</li>
<li>Escaping the Build Trap - Melissa Perri (Great reminders and frameworks for product managers)</li>
<li>The Power of Habit - Charles Duhigg (Even though I had encountered these theories frequently since college, I still found this a great read. I actually found the applications to business most compelling, especially if you're founding a company.)</li>
<li>Pinball, 1973 (The Rat, #2) - Haruki Murakami (A great novel, definitely feels like early Murakami. Flashes of his genius, but not quite truly magical like some of his other work.)</li>
<li>The Tipping Point - Malcolm Gladwell (I've found a very healthy relationship with reading MG balancing genuine excitement for interesting ideas with a healthy dose of skepticism regarding the confidence with which he presents research...)</li>
<li>Never Enough - Judith Grisel (Incredibly interesting read on the nature of addiction, I recommend for everyone)</li>
<li>Norwegian Wood - Haruki Murakami (Murakami's most popular book. I actually found it less interesting than his other more experimental work. Nonetheless, a great novel :) perfect gateway drug for newcomers to Murakami)</li>
<li>Hagakure - Yamamoto Tsunetomo (An entertaining + beautiful glimpse into samurai culture in the early 1700s Edo period. This translation is excellent...)</li>
<li>The Hard Thing About Hard Things - Ben Horowitz (Great book for anyone interested in tech / interested in starting their own business. Very practical...)</li>
<li>The Overdue Life of Amy Byler - Kelly Harms (I loved this novel as an easy reader to break up denser / more difficult literature!!...)</li>
<li>A Pale View of Hills - Kazuo Ishiguro (In true Ishiguro form, this novel will stay with me. It's haunting and beautiful in all the right ways...)</li>
<li>Beyond Brilliance - Lucas Miller (One of my favorite learning resources ever, truly changed the way I approach learning (even after college). The best part of this book is its digestibility...)</li>
<li>Venture Deals - Brad Feld</li>
<li>Inherent Vice - Thomas Pynchon (Another masterpiece from Pynchon. Incredible postmodern literature. I can't wait to read this one again)</li>
<li>The New Financial Capitalists - George P. Baker (Fantastic profile on one of the most innovative and important firms in the history of American business...)</li>
<li>Recursion - Blake Crouch (One of the best novels I've read in a while. Beautiful, smart, poignant, thrilling, and totally engrossing...)</li>
<li>Kafka on the Shore - Haruki Murakami (Best summary of Murakami, per NYT: ‚Yet the undercurrent is nearly irresistible...)</li>
<li>The Bell Jar - Sylvia Plath (Powerful novel by a powerful writer. Beyond the hard-hitting content Plath is known for, I also loved her use of form...)</li>
<li>Shoe Dog - Phil Knight (Great read about the entrepreneurial spirit. More about the 0-1 then later days! I enjoyed hearing about all the twists and turns of their story.)</li>
<li>Killing Commendatore - Haruki Murakami (This novel is peak Murakami... unbelievably satisfying at times, unbelievably frustrating at others...)</li>
<li>The Souls of Yellow Folk - Wesley Yang (Thank you, Wesley Yang, for capturing very poignantly what it feels like to be an Asian American...)</li>
<li>A Man Called Ove - Fredrik Backman (A charming pleasure-read. Enjoyed making my way through this novel :) )</li>
<li>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World - Haruki Murakami (Beautiful, loved Murakami's use of contrast / dichotomy throughout this novel)</li>
<li>The Sirens of Titan - Kurt Vonnegut Jr. (‘The Sirens of Titan’ feels like a long, winding hike through underbrush that finally culminates in a poignant sunset view...)</li>
<li>Ready Player One - Ernest Cline (Very enjoyable, accessible sci-fi! This is a really lighthearted read...)</li>
<li>Cannery Row - John Steinbeck (An enjoyable read. Formally, Steinbeck crafts mini stories into delightful little parcels...)</li>
<li>Lake Success - Gary Shteyngart (A great novel, lots to think about)</li>
<li>The Lean Startup - Eric Ries (Important ideas, a must-read for all startup practitioners)</li>
<li>Steal Like an Artist - Austin Kleon (Thought-provoking, very concise, and easily digestible. Definitely worth sitting down with a coffee and knocking out in one morning!)</li>
<li>The Miracle Morning - Hal Elrod (Lots of fluff, but also loved the actionable steps. It's worked in my life!)</li>
<li>Slaughterhouse-Five - Kurt Vonnegut Jr.</li>
<li>The Tale of Genji - Murasaki Shikibu (A Christmas gift from my little brother! Been on my list for a while...)</li>
<li>All I Asking for Is My Body - Milton Murayama</li>

<h3>⭐️⭐️⭐️ güd</h3>
<li>Hocus Pocus - Kurt Vonnegut Jr.</li>
<li>Shalako - Louis L'Amour</li>
<li>A Farewell to Arms - Ernest Hemingway</li>
<li>The Fountainhead - Ayn Rand (Good Ayn Rand, more clunky and heavy-handed than Atlas Shrugged)</li>
<li>The Sisters Brothers - Patrick deWitt (A fine western novel.)</li>
<li>Convenience Store Woman - Sayaka Murata (An enjoyable, short novel! A great concept that to me never evolved into something greater. Nonetheless, I'm excited to read Earthlings next.)</li>
<li>Crossing the Chasm: Marketing and Selling Disruptive Products to Mainstream Customers - Geoffrey A. Moore</li>
<li>Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts - Annie Duke (A really interesting idea and concept, but it's a simple enough idea that I'm not sure a whole book is needed to appreciate it. I might suggest consuming a podcast featuring the author instead.)</li>
<li>Inspired: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love - Marty Cagan (...Credit where credit's due...this may have been groundbreaking 10+ years ago and I am taking for granted how much impact this book has had...)</li>
<li>Product Management's Sacred Seven - Parth Detroja (A nice compendium, more like a textbook / glossary without any narrative form. Good for reference material, would benefit even more with an index.)</li>
<li>The Hollywood Economist 2.0 - Edward Jay Epstein (An excellent read! ...outdated due to Netflix / streaming wars. Still a great economic history of Hollywood.)</li>
<li>Decode and Conquer - Lewis C. Lin (Good intro to PM interviews, worth a read for context.)</li>
<li>Bartleby the Scrivener - Herman Melville (An interesting short story. Absurdist...)</li>
<li>The Bridegroom - Ha Jin (Delightful short stories. I really enjoyed seeing modern-day China through the author's eyes.)</li>
<li>All You Need to Know About the Music Business - Donald S. Passman (Really comprehensive...accessible to outsiders...includes a “fast track” through the book.)</li>
<li>Richard II - William Shakespeare (“Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs…”)</li>
<li>Anthem - Ayn Rand (Compelling read in today's political climate regardless of political ideology)</li>
<li>Things Fall Apart - Chinua Achebe (Appreciated especially with context of postcolonial lit...)</li>
<li>What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures - Malcolm Gladwell (Really interesting ideas, but weaker as a collection.)</li>
<li>Brave New World - Aldous Huxley (A great comp to 1984—similarly very interesting ideas, more closely resembles our world today IMO.)</li>
<li>The Accidental Billionaires - Ben Mezrich (Very entertaining...reads cinematically...more drama than detail.)</li>
<li>Severance - Ling Ma (Excellent contemporary novel...especially relevant in today’s pandemic-impacted world.)</li>
<li>Who Owns the Future? - Jaron Lanier (Genius ideas but very disorganized. Worthwhile if you know it’s going to be a slog for the gems.)</li>
<li>Never Let Me Go - Kazuo Ishiguro (A beautiful novel, very moving. Loved it.)</li>
<li>The Beautiful and Damned - F. Scott Fitzgerald (A staple of the Lost Generation canon. Enjoyed it!)</li>
<li>Interior Chinatown - Charles Yu (Loved this book! Insightful and deeply engaging commentary on Asian American identity.)</li>
<li>This Could Be Our Future - Yancey Strickler (Good read, interesting ideas...would have loved to see more actionable solutions.)</li>
<li>Timequake - Kurt Vonnegut Jr. (Intimate, more memoir than narrative...best for Vonnegut veterans.)</li>
<li>Here Comes the Sun - Nicole Y. Dennis-Benn (A beautiful and poignant novel from beginning to end.)</li>
<li>Bird by Bird - Anne Lamott (A beautiful and fun book for anyone interested in writing.)</li>
<li>The First Tycoon - T.J. Stiles (Well-researched biography of Cornelius Vanderbilt...very detailed and may be too long for casual readers.)</li>
<li>House Made of Dawn - N. Scott Momaday (A powerful novel about cultural identity and spiritual experience.)</li>
<li>Down and Out in Paris and London - George Orwell (Straightforward, realist...felt slightly voyeuristic given Orwell’s privileged position.)</li>
<li>The Intelligent Investor - Benjamin Graham (The value investing Bible...loved the commentary from Jason Zweig.)</li>
<li>Galápagos - Kurt Vonnegut Jr. (Interesting formally...less engaging than other Vonnegut novels.)</li>
<li>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? - Philip K. Dick (Weak narrative, but the worldbuilding is top-tier. Great scifi ideas.)</li>
<li>Becoming a Venture Capitalist - Gary Rivlin (Nice overview of VC industry. Not much new if you're already familiar.)</li>
<li>A Room of One's Own - Virginia Woolf (Loved her exploration of the intersection between economics and the artistic process for women.)</li>
<li>The Godfather of Silicon Valley - Gary Rivlin (Great snapshot of the dot-com bubble and angel investing.)</li>
<li>Cat's Cradle - Kurt Vonnegut Jr.</li>
<li>Managing Oneself - Peter F. Drucker</li>
<li>The Remains of the Day - Kazuo Ishiguro (Beautiful reflection on missed chances and the passage of time...haunting in its quiet power.)</li>

<h3>⭐️⭐️ would not recommend</h3>
<li>Even Cowgirls Get the Blues - Tom Robbins (An interesting postmodern novel, with moments of brilliance, but relatively heavy-handed. Middle 100 pages are author philosophizing. More about author than characters (one dimensional, static), and thus reads like a postmodern literary exercise, rather than a novel for entertainment.)</li>
<li>The Last Tycoon - F. Scott Fitzgerald (As advertised, reads like a Fitzgerald work-in-progress. Pretty flat affect, to be expected since he wasn't given the time to properly manifest his vision. If anything, made me better appreciate how much of Fitzgerald's genius is in his execution.)</li>
<li>Bushido: The Soul of Japan (AmazonClassics Edition) - Nitobe Inazō (As a Japanese American, I've learned about my heritage passively over time by osmosis. I purchased this book to begin a more formal investigation of my heritage. I found this book to be really difficult to read. Instead of making his own points, the author instead makes countless references to Western philosophy to make his points for him...)</li>
<li>As I Lay Dying - William Faulkner (While I recognize Faulkner's importance to American literature, I always really struggle to enjoy his work. Faulkner claimed to have written As I Lay Dying (AILD) from midnight - 4am over several weeks, and I feel like this shows...)</li>
<li>Living by the Code - Enrique López Mañas (Among advice books (which I'm starting to grow wary of) this is a good one for both junior and senior developers! It's interesting seeing a bunch of advice stacked back-to-back to see common threads that bind them...)</li>
<li>Want - Lynn Steger Strong (Interesting contemporary novel about the trials of life as a middle class woman in America)</li>
<li>The Cement Garden - Ian McEwan (My second McEwan novel... liked this one far less... felt heavy-handed and gratuitous. Felt like a cheap Lord of the Flies knockoff.)</li>
<li>The Fall - Albert Camus (I was looking forward to The Fall, as Camus' _The Plague_ is one of my favorite novels ever due to its incredibly beautiful prose and challenging ideas. Conversely, The Fall feels flat / one-dimensional due to its monologue form and linear progression...)</li>
<li>Mrs. Dalloway - Virginia Woolf (While important to modernism, did not enjoy this read. More accessible than Ulysses, but lacks the spine-tingling spark that I'm used to from Woolf. Meh...)</li>
<li>Less (Arthur Less, #1) - Andrew Sean Greer</li>

<h3>❓ (forgot to rate)</h3>
<li>Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us - Seth Godin (My first introduction to the writing of Godin... ultimately, this is a motivational speech, not a book with intellectual merit. I don't recommend as a book to anyone.)</li>
